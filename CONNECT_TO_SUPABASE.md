# Connect to Your Existing Supabase "recruitment" Project

## 🔗 Current Status
The authentication system is built but not yet connected to your actual Supabase project. Here's how to connect it:

## Step 1: Get Your Project Credentials

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your **"recruitment"** project
3. Navigate to **Settings → API**
4. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL**: `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co`
   - **Anon/Public Key**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ik...`

## Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Create/Update your `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Your actual Supabase "recruitment" project credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here

# Optional: For admin operations
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

## Step 3: Configure Authentication Settings

In your Supabase "recruitment" project dashboard:

1. Go to **Authentication → Settings**
2. **Site URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Additional Redirect URLs**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   http://localhost:3000/login
   http://localhost:3000/signup
   ```

## Step 4: Test Connection

Once configured, I can use the Supabase MCP to:
- ✅ Verify the connection
- ✅ Check existing tables
- ✅ Create recruitment-specific schema
- ✅ Set up proper authentication

## Current Authentication Features Ready:
- 🔐 Login/Signup pages with beautiful shadcn UI
- 🛡️ Protected routes with middleware
- 👤 User session management
- 🚪 Logout functionality
- ✅ Form validation and error handling

## Next Steps:
1. **You provide the credentials** (or I can guide you to get them)
2. **I'll connect using Supabase MCP** to verify everything works
3. **Set up recruitment-specific database tables** if needed
4. **Test the full authentication flow**

Would you like me to guide you through getting your Supabase "recruitment" project credentials, or do you have them ready?
