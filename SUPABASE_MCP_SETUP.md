# Supabase MCP Configuration Issue

## 🔍 Current Problem
The Supabase MCP is returning: **"Project reference in URL is not valid"**

This means the MCP server needs to be configured with your specific "recruitment" project reference.

## 🛠️ How to Fix This

### Option 1: Configure MCP with Project Reference
The Supabase MCP likely needs to be configured with your project reference. Check if there's a configuration file or environment variable that needs:

```
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=your-actual-project-ref
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co  
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Option 2: Direct Connection
Alternatively, I can help you:
1. **Get your project details manually** from Supabase dashboard
2. **Update the environment variables** in our Next.js app
3. **Test the connection** directly

## 🎯 What I Need to Help You

To proceed with either approach, I need to know:
1. **Where is the Supabase MCP configured?** (configuration file location)
2. **What are your actual project credentials?**
   - Project Reference (like `abcdefghijklmn`)
   - Project URL (like `https://abcdefghijklmn.supabase.co`)
   - Anon Key

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once the MCP is properly configured, I can immediately:
- ✅ List all your existing tables
- ✅ Check what data you already have
- ✅ Create recruitment-specific schema if needed
- ✅ Set up proper authentication
- ✅ Generate TypeScript types
- ✅ Test the complete system

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
